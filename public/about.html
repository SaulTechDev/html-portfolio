<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am learning how to creat and develop a Web site because it is such and important ability this days.
The idea to interact in line on real time with the world is so great.
The more I learn to be a developer the more I like it and helps me to creat more ideas in how I will interact.
</p>

<p>My professional formation as a science alow me to be flexible enough to understand the process of learning.
To me this is like a new lenguage or a new coding from where I can communicate.</p>
